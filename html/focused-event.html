			<div class = "content">
				<p>Food for the Fourth kicked off our first ever event with some old-fashioned grassroots fliering. Our president attended the annual Lititz Fourth of July celebration with info cards listing the facts on the role of food banks in America and encouraging donation during the Independence day season. Over the course of the day, she distributed over 500 cards to celebration attendees. Response was highly positive, and several attendees expressed interest in donating to the Firework Food Drive to be held later that week.</p><p>Food for the Fourth hopes to expand our presence at the Lititz Fourth of July 2020.</p></div>
